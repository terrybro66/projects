## 1. Bus Routes
### Step 1: Set up a new React project and install necessary dependencies

Git Message: "Initialize React project and install dependencies for map visualization"

### Step 2: Define the application's file structure, separating concerns such as components, utilities, and data services.

Git Message: "Define project file structure for components, utilities, and data services"

### Step 3: Integrate Mapbook-GL JS with React to display the base map.

Git Message: "Integrate mapbook-GL for base map display"

### Step 4: Add PolygonLayer to represent buildings and TripsLayer for visualizing trip data.

Git Message: "Add PolygonLayer for buildings and TripsLayer for trip visualization"

### Step 5: Configure initial view state and map style.

Git Message: "Configure initial map view state and style"

### Step 6: Implement ambient and point lighting using Deck.gl's LightingEffect.

Git Message: "Implement ambient and point lighting for enhanced visualization"

### Step 7: Configure materials and effects to enhance the visual quality of the 3D buildings and trips.

Git Message: "Configure materials and effects for 3D buildings and trips visualization"

### Step 8: Add state management for animation control and implement the animation loop to visualize trips over time.

Git Message: "Add state management for animation control and implement animation loop"

### Step 9: Integrate real-time data fetching using WebSockets or another appropriate technology to update the trips layer dynamically.

Git Message: "Integrate real-time data fetching for dynamic trips layer updates"

### Step 10: Implement UI controls (e.g., sliders, checkboxes) to allow users to interact with the visualization (e.g., adjusting animation speed, toggling layers).

Git Message: "Implement UI controls for user interaction with visualization"

### Step 11: Bind UI control states to the application's state and update the visualization based on user interaction.

Git Message: "Bind UI control states to application state for dynamic visualization updates"

### Step 12: Explore and integrate additional Deck.gl layers (e.g., ScatterplotLayer, HeatmapLayer) as needed to represent different data sets.

Git Message: "Integrate additional Deck.gl layers for advanced data representation"

### Step 13: Enhance the application's visual appeal and user experience with additional effects, such as fog or post-processing effects.

Git Message: "Enhance visual appeal and user experience with advanced effects"

### Step 14: Perform thorough testing across different devices and browsers to ensure compatibility and performance.

Git Message: "Perform comprehensive testing for compatibility and performance"

### Step 15: Refine the UI/UX, optimize performance, and clean up the codebase.

Git Message: "Refine UI/UX, optimize performance, and clean up codebase"
